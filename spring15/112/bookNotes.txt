The EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers are called data registers or general registers.
The EAX register is sometimes known as the accumulator since it is the destination
for many arithmetic results. An example of an instruction using the EAX register is
add eax, 158
which adds the decimal number 158 (converted to doubleword length 2â€™s complement
form) to the number already in EAX, replacing the number originally in EAX by the sum.

EAX reg is 32 bits long
0-15 = AX
0-7 = AL
8-15 = AH
