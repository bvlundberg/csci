		   + D9CC 		   -9780   +55756
		   	 0410 1 CO		1040	66576 but there carry out exceeds the 
		   	 							  word limit of 65536

		   	 0000010000010000

		   	 In the unsigned number convention, the value has carry out from the sign bit, meaning that it exceeded the word limit of 65536, so the answer is incorrect.

		   	 In the signed number convention, the first number is positive and the second number is negative, so there will be no overflow, meaning that the answer will be correct

		   	In the unsigned number convention, the value has carry out from the sign bit, meaning that it exceeded the word limit of 65536, so the answer is incorrect.

		   	In the signed number convention, both numbers are negative, but the answer is positive, meaning that overflow occurred.

   	    	0111110001100000
   	    	
   	    	In the unsigned number system, the value is less than 0, which is not possible in the unsigned system.

   	    	In the signed number system, you are subtracting a number, so I switched the second number to its twos complement form and added the values. then, it was adding two positive numbers with no overflow, so i know that the answer was correct.
