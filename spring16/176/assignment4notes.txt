Assignment 4 Questions
a.  Private Variables  - count, i (both are unique per thread)
    Shared Variables   - a, n, temp (these values are used and needed for each thread)
    
b. No, there are no loop dependencies. Variable i is assigned by the for loop. Variable count is unique per thread and always starts at 0. Array a and variable n are basically used as read only (non changing). Array temp is only updated in one location per thread. None of the operations are dependent of each other.

c. Yes. Threads could be designated to handle copying over elements of the array from the for loop, either in the form of blocks or rotationally like we have discussed in class.
